# Smart Measurements in Sports and Physical Activity  
Project â€“ A.Y. 2023/2024  

Study on the impact of aerobic training frequency and rest days on aerobic and anaerobic performance, comparing active and sedentary subjects. Data were collected via smartphones with GPS and built-in accelerometers, analyzing running distance, energy expenditure, and vertical jump height.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- Aim: Assess how a 10-day running program affects aerobic and anaerobic performance in active vs sedentary individuals.  
- Participants: 3 subjects (1 active, 2 sedentary).  
- Protocol: 20 minutes of running daily (2 subjects) or every other day (1 subject), with vertical jump tests pre and post training.  
- Tools: Smartphones with GPS (1 Hz) and accelerometers (50 Hz), data processed in MATLAB, energy expenditure via IAA + Bouten model, running distance, and jump analysis via flight time method.

## ðŸ”¬ Key Findings
- Sedentary subjects showed faster and more consistent improvements in distance compared to the active subject.  
- Rest days promoted better recovery and adaptation in sedentary participants.  
- The active subject plateaued around day 8, suggesting adaptation limits.  
- No significant improvements in jump height for the active subject; small gains in sedentary participants.  
- Energy expenditure estimation was biased by accelerometer placement (arm vs centerÂ ofÂ mass).
